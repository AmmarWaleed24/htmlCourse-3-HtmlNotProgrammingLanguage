# HTML is **Not** a Programming Language

HTML is **not** a programming language. It is a **markup language**. Here's why:

---

## **What is a Markup Language?**

- A markup language is used to structure and annotate content, such as text, images, and other media, for display or processing.
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is specifically designed to define the structure and semantics of web content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.

## **Why HTML is Not a Programming Language**

1. **No Logic**
    - Programming languages allow you to write logic, perform calculations, and control the flow of execution (e.g., loops, conditionals).
    - HTML does not have the ability to execute logic or manipulate data. It simply describes the structure of a document.
2. **Static Nature**
    - HTML defines static content that doesn't change on its own. To make web pages dynamic, you need to use programming languages like JavaScript.
3. **Declarative vs Imperative**
    - HTML is declarative: You declare what the structure of your content should look like.
    - Programming languages are imperative: You instruct the computer step-by-step on what to do.

## **What HTML Does**

- Defines the structure and meaning of content on a web page.
- Example:

```html
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## **What Makes Something a Programming Language?**

A programming language typically includes:

- Variables and data types.
- Control structures (if/else, loops).
- Functions or methods.
- Ability to manipulate data and produce outputs.

For example, **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **C++** are programming languages because they can perform computations, handle user input, and interact with systems.
